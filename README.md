# EM-simulation
It is an electromagnetic simulation that deals with simple EM problems
This simulation model deals with particles as solid spheres. It is not good or efficient for calculating anything useful. It suffers greatly from the rounding
errors and is incredibly flawed due to it being in Java Script. I know. It's bad. It was meant as a learning opportunity also my submission for my Computer Science A-Level. Feel free to use the code here as it does what it says on the tin. It employs the Cango Library. This library was mostly lost but it should exist under this

This library is not my work. I have added it here as it is employed heavily to make the code do what it does

The project was finished at about the Middle of 2017
